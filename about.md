Hi! My name is Emilio Cobos, and I'm a CS student in [University of Salamanca](https://usal.es).

I love coding and learning new things.
Hopefully I'll take my time to write them up here.

My primary interests as of right now are systems programming and low level graphics.
They tend to vary hugely over time (which I consider good).

As of today, I don't really know what to write here. Maybe I write some quirks I think people could find useful, maybe I post some course notes...

You can checkout my [resume](/resume.pdf), my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/ecoal95), my [Gitlab account](https://gitlab.com/eca) or my [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ecbos_).

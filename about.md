<p>Hi! My name is <span class="p-name">Emilio</span>, and I work for
<a href="https://mozilla.org">Mozilla</a> on Gecko, Firefox's rendering
engine.</p>

<p>I'm also lucky enough to do various Rust things, and work on CSS standards with
the awesome people at the <a href="https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts">CSS
WG</a>.</p>

<p>I do various other stuff, which are usually public and accessible in
<a rel="me" href="https://github.com/emilio">my GitHub profile</a>. I also have
an (under used) <a href="https://gitlab.com/eca">GitLab profile</a>.</p>

<p>To reach out you can <a class="u-email" href="mailto:emilio@crisal.io">email
me</a>, or mention me on <a href="https://twitter.com/ecbos_">Twitter</a>, or
something :)</p>

Hi! My name is Emilio, and I work for [Mozilla](https://mozilla.org) on Gecko,
Firefox's rendering engine.

I'm also lucky enough to do various Rust things, and work on CSS standards with
the awesome folks at the [CSS WG](https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts).

I do various other stuff, which are usually public and accessible in
[my GitHub profile](https://github.com/emilio). I also have an (under used)
[GitLab profile](https://gitlab.com/eca).

To reach out you can [email me](mailto:emilio@crisal.io), or mention me on
[Twitter](https://twitter.com/ecbos_), or something :)

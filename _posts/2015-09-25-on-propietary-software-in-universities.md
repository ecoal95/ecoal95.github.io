title:  On writing software with propietary tools in universities

I study in the University of Salamanca, a public university here in Spain.

This year we have a mandatory subject called *Interfaces Gr√°ficas de Usuario*
(*Graphical User Interfaces*), where we use two technologies:

* Windows WPF
* Cocoa

We will spend a few months with each, but... Why the heck do we have to use
this technologies?

## Propietary technologies should be optional

That's my whole point. We shouldn't be **forced** to use this kind of technologies.
**Over all in a public university**.

Yes, it is true that most people have access to a Windows system, and at least
my university partners with Microsoft and we can get a free Windows copy while
we're students (by the way, thanks to the creator of
[VSVim](https://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/59ca71b3-a4a3-46ca-8fe1-0e90e3f79329)
who made my life much happier today).

But it's also true that the same does not happen with Mac systems... I don't
have one (and most of my classmates don't either). To course this
(remember, mandatory) subject, **I'll need to either buy an OS X system
(which I can't afford) or be illegal and install Hackintosh in my computer**.

So yes, I'm pretty **pissed off**.

In this specific subject I think **the web platform would be the best choice**.

But then well, the teachers will have to teach real concepts, and no how to
play with an IDE... I think eons will pass before the web is taught in my
university...
